really great! It did flicker when I first got it but I think it was because the batteries were covered in some kind of oil, but all I did was wipe them clean and problem fixed","1":"Worked just great and I was very happy with the packaging.","2":"Right out the package the light flickers - not constantly but enough to be incredibly annoying. I thought maybe it just needed a new battery but a new battery did not make any difference.","3":"OK, feels cheap and plasticy, but works. Loud keys.","4":"The stock cameras with the nightowl systems are a quite narrow field, and i was looking for something that would cover my entire back screen enclosed pool, and also my front porch\/entry area.  These cameras do a great job of that, and are quite discrete.  I must warn that they disclaim these as INDOOR cameras, but the blue line is a gasket, and I have both of mine tucked tight against the house, so they never see water, just moisture in the air.  I've also sealed up any gaps with silicone.\n\nI was worried when having to turn them tight into the \"corner\" of the dome that i'd have IR reflection or permanent night mode (the daylight sensor is below the dome edge, but it didn't happen.  Lastly I haven't played with the button control, as the images were fine to my liking as they came.  I only wish (this of all button control cameras) that they'd mount the button so that you could use it after the camera was mounted...my button is buried in the wall now.  If you could take off the dome, and access buttons under that, then that would be great.  However, this is nothing to remove a star for.  These are great!","5":"Very nice keyboard that came with no instructions of how to install it so I had to just figure it out for myself. It did not say that it supported any OS above XP so I was a bit concerned at first. Yet with a little \"techy\" knowledge and trying this and that I finally got the settings available to work. It is very comfortable to type on and plugs into my current OS Windows 7 laptop via USB. I gave it a 4 star because of the absence of instructions on how to use it. I cannot tell you if it will work with Windows 8 or 10 as all my laptops have Windows 7. Apparrently the keyboard is an older model as it said it works with Windows 2000, Vista and XP. Overall it is a handy keyboard for the Bilingual student.","6":"OK product","7":"Good product","8":"cleans  all my stuff","9":"Keys work as they ought. But lacked any information as to how the keyboard functions. Had to go to Microsoft to determine how you switch from one to the other. Once practice some will return to give a deeper review of the product","10":"Did not help my car CD player.","11":"I had originally purchased some Monoprice multi-zone speaker selector switches.  The price couldn't be beat, and they had an impedance-protection switch.  I de-soldered all five switches, wired in a relay board controlled by an Arduino, and ended up with a web-controlled network speaker zone selector switch.  It worked fine, but there were two issues: 1.) the power sinking when the impedance protection is active is pretty high, and 2.) the speakers in the different zones have different sensitivity, so the volume levels from room to room were not consistent.\n\nDue to the cost, I had avoided a  product like the Russound SDB-4.1 in the first place.  However, a marketplace seller had a used SDB-4.1 for a relatively low price.  It arrived without the 4 wire terminal connectors, but that was easily remedied by getting \"10Pcs 300V 15A 5.08mm Pitch 4-Pin PCB Screw Terminal Block Connectors\" from Amazon.  After that, I was ready to go.  Since I don't have any fancy metering equipment, I set the room levels by ear.  Driving all four zones at once requires much less amplifier power than before.  I've since fit this device with the Arduino and relay board, and it's working great.\n\nI'm extremely happy with this purchase, but would have a hard time justifying it at any higher price than what I paid for it used.","12":"Works as advertised.","13":"Works good but volume can only be turned down.","14":"Worked well with two stereo's I have, cleared up the problems with both of them.","15":"I've been somewhat satisfied with the product but, if I were to buy one again, I'd buy a unit with simpler and larger controls. The buttons are very small for a man's hands to operate and are hard to understand their functions!","16":"good for maintenance...","17":"Good stereo but cannot change the color, Stays red.","18":"I tried to clean CD lens in a Sony music station. It doesn't work. besides of that, this Sony device was no able to read the content of the disc. A totally lost of money!","19":"I am only giving it two starts because all the other functions work except radio. I have double checked the wired harnesses and the antenna adapter Metra 40-CR10 Chrysler 2001-Up Car Antenna Adapter, but I can't get the radio to work at all. Even without a antenna plugged in it should pick up a signal. Nothing at all just all static.\nEdit 11\/21\/2016\nNow usb port is also not working when I tested it. It only charges my phone and doesn't read any device. Changing my rating from 2 stars to 1 and replacing the unit.","20":"Very useful product","21":"Works great has good power to run four 2way 5 . Went in and programmed it with ease. One weak point it the built in crossover for the subs. Left in some of the mids and makes it muddy.","22":"Worked great.  After one use, my car CD player stopped skipping when the car went over bumps, along with no more rejecting certain CDs.","23":"I was looking for a stereo to replace the one I had in my 2001 Honda Accord. The stereo had already been replaced once but I wanted something that would offer Bluetooth and aux capabilities. I had never installed a stereo before but this one was totally straight forwards. It came with the wiring harness I needed to connect to the stereo unit itself but you will need one to hook in on the car end of the wiring. I happened to have one already installed from the previous upgrade that I was able to use. Wiring the harnesses is not a hard process - all I had to do was follow the diagrams and colors. In terms of functionality, I have been using this for several months with relative ease. The Bluetooth feature works quite well and often my phone would sync just when I started the car. I haven't used the call feature much but it seems fine. I have had some issues with USB connectivity but I didn't look much in to it. Otherwise, I am wholly pleased with the product and ease of install.\n\nThings I needed for the install:\nElectrical tape (for splicing wires on the harnesses)\nRCA splitter (a previous upgrade had a four way split on the speakers but this only has two)\nPhillips head screwdriver\nYoutube instructionals\nWiring harness to connect to the car","24":"Disc works fine but the case was broken","25":"Decent stereo. I did install myself after purchasing some wiring harness and a double din bracket. Works fine. Microphone for handstree calling doesn't really pick up the voice that well and all my callers complain of echos. Other than that, it's a good stereo for the price.","26":"the dry cd cleaner are ok but one with the liquid works better","27":"So far seems good, i will update if that changes.  good value for features .","28":"I used this in my car's 6 CD changer. I ran it a couple times before I heard a difference in my music. Maxell is a good name and I recommend this to clean CD players.","29":"Installed in a boat - works amazingly for a cheapo deck I am very happy with it so far. Well featured Bluetooth stereo.","30":"This product really works very well!","31":"What a great deal this unit is! Works perfect with my IPhone. Imagine my surprise as I was listening to music played via BT on my phone, when all of a sudden my wife's name pops up on the display and hit one button to answer her call, all wireless! I spent $100 to have it professionally installed, they mounted the microphone in the dashboard behind the steering wheel and it works perfectly. Sound is great, easy to use, what a gem for the price. The BT connection was simple and the controls are easy to figure out. Well done JVC, would not expect less they have been around long enough.","32":"Thought this  would work well ... tried it twice in my car. Doesn't  do a very good job. Another piece of junk ...don't waste your time.","33":"Very nice stereo for a good price.","34":"ok","35":"Was able to add hands free phone calling to my wife's car pretty cheap. It was a simple DIY job which made me a SUPERSTAR at home!!","36":"Product works fine. Unfortunately my problem was with my CD player and not the disks.","37":"LOOKS GOOD, HAVEN'T INSTALLED IT YET HOWEVER.","38":"Didn't work for what I bought it for, but it might have been the CD Player is just too old for it to work on.","39":"I am very pleased with the stereo so far.\n\nPros: superb sound quality\nSupports Google Voice dialing\nPandora\nGreat documentation\nEasy to pair\n\nCons: no color customizations for the lights","40":"It did clean my cds. I think it's the player. Spits out the cds in cold weather.","41":"My husband installed this in an hour.  We needed to buy installation kit and antenna adapter from ABC warehouse.  It takes some getting used to but I love how you get into the car with your music playing and the radio turns on.  Microphone doesn't work all that great,  especially if the person you're talking to has a blue tooth on.  I'm sure it has tons of features I have not yet discovered.","42":"I began having issues with a DVD drive and was considering replacing it with an upgrade, but I decided to try this first since I had it handy.  It fixed the problem in one use and has saved me from purchasing an expensive replacement.","43":"My dad \"wow, you called me on the phone, not on a bluetooth headset or stereo?\"  My one fear was that this wouldn't support amazon music since it advertises pandora and I heart radio.  Amazon music can be controlled under the bt music tab with full controls.  Next song.  Previous song.  Pause ect. Display reads the song name\/album\/singer\/time.  Microphone (I hear) sounds great and can be adjusted for higher output volume.  I mounted the mike on the sunroof control on the roof about 11 inchest away from my face.  I've used a jawbone headset and a Aukey bluetooth control, and with both I couldn't have the ac on or it interfered with popping wind noise transmitted thru the mike.  Yesterday I had the ac on high in the 104 degree heat with the blower right on my face with no complaints.","44":"VERY GOOD.","45":"a lot of nice features.  works mush better with antenna!","46":"The CD did a great job cleaning the player in my car which I'd bought used a couple of years ago. It went from not being able to play CD's\/audio cutting out in the middle of a track, to crisp and clear delivery without the need to replace the CD player. I did have to run it a few times given how old the player was at that point (14 years), but it got the job done and I was impressed. Dust and dirt from the years were brushed away from the lens over a few minutes and saved me buying a new CD player for the car.","47":"Good stereo, easy to install.","48":"It cleaned up the skipping on my CD's.","49":"Great for my 2015 Hobie Pro Angler 12","50":"Works as advertised worth buying if you to optimize your listening experience.","51":"Mount easy and doesn't move in rough water.","52":"Bought this product to clean the lens in my truck cd player and also laptop. Folled simple directions and it didn't work, disappointed, have to look for an alternative lens cleaner.","53":"Perfect fit with my Lowrance HOOK 5, CHIRP 5, HDI 5 or Elite Ti5 or 7.  Will also fit the Elite 4 models if you prefer a larger ball size 1.5\").  No mounting screws included ... since they don't know where or how you plan on mounting it.","54":"I bought this in attempt to fix my disc drive in my mac. But it didn't work.","55":"Received from Amazon in only 2 days. Like others have posted, the post between the upper ball and the bracket had paint missing.  This appears to be a manufacturing QC issue and is not from a returned item. I sanded the area and hit it with black spray paint. Problem solved!  This is a large, heavy duty mount.  It does not come with mounting screws or a description of the recommended screw\/bolt size.","56":"It Works!","57":"Super solid mounting system. Cannot wait to install and will update my review after installation and some field testing.","58":"Could be better.","59":"Great.......get it","60":"Great product and really fast shipping","61":"Ii am very pleased with product and service.","62":"Good item thank you.","63":"More or less fixed my wrist pain.  A bit difficult to click on finely-defined things, but overall a good solution.","64":"Good item thank you.","65":"It literally hurts to use most mice after too many decades on computers.  While this is not a fancy mouse - and is overpriced for what is just an extra-large plastic mouse - it is much less painful to use than anything else I've tried.\n\nIf it helps you make a decision, I'm 6'2 with very large hands and long fingers.","66":"Didn't work for me.","67":"fast shipping and good price","68":"Didn't work for me.","69":"Very good","70":"I was ready to purchase a new player and decided to try this instead. My player would skip, would stop, and screen would go blank. This lens cleaner was delivered quickly and worked perfectly. I saved having to buy a new unitCouldnt ask for any more than that. THANK YOU :-)","71":"It is a fan.  It moves a good amount of air, although when at full power it tends to be a bit noisy. I usually run it at around 5.5 volts to keep the noise down.  It helps to keep my GTX770 cool, and the white LEDs look good, so I believe that it was a good purchase.  I would buy this again if I needed another one.  It should last longer than the Cooler Master fan it replaced.","72":"I was ready to purchase a new player and decided to try this instead. My player would skip, would stop, and screen would go blank.

Thanks","79":"Works great and lights up bright!","80":"used it ,worked perfectly and did the job,No problems or recurrence of my problems since used. Thanks","81":"Due to the shape, will not fit the standard fan mount on my case.  This might be mostly the fault of the case, but the photos of these fans are very poor and inconsistent so I was unable to verify the shape before purchase.  Returned for refund.","82":"Works Great!","83":"Good airflow, silent, mount in any position, LEDs are bright. Very happy.","84":"Works Great!","85":"Installed this on my newest computer build. Replaced the smaller fans in the front of my BitFenix Prodigy case and I can't tell the fan is on unless I look at the blades spin. It's super quiet a sleeps the temps down in my case.","86":"works really well","87":"The image is very misleading. The leds are about a quarter as bright as the image.","88":"works really well","89":"Nice 230 fan but I didn't like the LED lights.&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/BitFenix-BFF-BLF-23030B-RP-Spectre-230mm-LED-Case-Fan-Blue\/dp\/B00EJIKKYA\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">BitFenix BFF-BLF-23030B-RP Spectre 230mm LED Case Fan, Blue<\/a>","90":"Great price!! And awe down item!!","91":"Worked better than I expected. Had to replaced a water cooler that will not fit my mini case.","92":"Great price!!

It's soft and flexible (I was kind of expecting the opposite) and it's plenty strong for my Fuji x-e1. I may get another one for another camera as well."},"brand":{"0":"Mighty Bright","1":"Visico","2":"Mighty Bright","3":"Simply type","4":"Gw","5":"Simply type","6":"Maxell","7":"Simply
