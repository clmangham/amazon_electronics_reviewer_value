It is everything that fiction should be -- beautifully written, engaging, well-plotted and structured.  It has several layers of meanings -- historical, family,  philosophical and more -- and blends them all skillfully and interestingly.  It makes the American grad student\/writers' workshop \"my parents were  mean to me and then my professors were mean to me\" trivia look  childish and silly by comparison, as they are.\nAnyone who says this is an  adolescent girl's coming of age story is trivializing it.  Ignore them.  Read this book if you love literature.\nI was particularly impressed with  this young author's grasp of the meaning and texture of the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's and '60's...particularly poignant when read in  1999 from another ruined and abandoned French colony, amid the decaying  buildings of Phnom Penh...\nI hope the author will write many more books  and that her publishers will bring her first novel back into print -- I  want to read it.  Thank you, Ms. Messud, for writing such a wonderful work.","1":"Pages and pages of introspection, in the style of writers like Henry James.  I like this kind of  novels and the writer occasionally delights me with her descriptions and observations.  But it's way too repetitious for me and, I think, some parts could have been cut out while still preserving, and probably more tightly crystallizing, the themes and \"truths\" within the story.\n\nIt's a story I could relate to but I wish it hadn't been too tedious to read.","2":"This is the kind of novel to read when you have time to lose yourself in a book for days, possibly weeks. I had to go back and reread it as soon as I finished it because it is so rich in historical and psychological  details, particularly themes centering on painful family dynamics and history.\n\nPotential readers of this novel by Claire Messud should know it isn't exactly a sunny, bouncy work. If you are looking for that you'll want to look elsewhere. It also moves between countries, including sections based in France, the U.S. and Algeria.\n\nThe focus of the novel is the LaBasse family and the story is told from the viewpoint of Sagesse, a woman who conveys the weight of a turbulent family history. Starting with Sagesse's grandfather, a man who owns the Hotel Bellevue in France,the family dynamics begin to play themselves out, connecting to larger themes of France and Algeria's history as well, with stunning consequences.\n\nSagesse's parents, Alex and Carol, reveal plenty about the kind of problems that can arise when there are cross-cultural challenges to face in a marriage. Carol, coming from America, marries Alex, but is unable to see the potential sacrifices and problems she'll face as she moves overseas to live with her husband...or the impact the marriage will have on her daughter and the rest of the family, including a handicapped son.\n\n It is a bit hard to categorize this book because it covers so many areas. It is part mystery because Sagesse is trying to separate truth from myth when figuring out her family's history. It is part suspense because of Sagesse's short love affair and a moment of violence (and I don't want to give the details of that moment or I'll spoil it for you). It is also a historical novel, rich with information about events in Algeria and France and the United States.\n\nFor me, also, this one centers on themes of personal identity and displacement,primarily for Sagesse, a woman trying to figure out where she belongs in the world and how to make peace with her difficult family as well as coming to grips with history's impact on her family.","3":"What gorgeous language! What an incredible writer! The Last Life is one of  the best written novels I have ever read. This incredible novel contains  various elements of fiction: historical, philosophical, and just the right  touch of magical realism.\nThe story is about a French-Algerian family  and the constant moving to different parts of the world -- the South of  France, the East Coast of the U.S. and Algeria -- has affected each of  their lives. It seems as though each family member has found his or her  identity in one of the many places they have been. As a result, they never  feel like they have found a home. The thing that struck me most when  reading this book was how the author described life in the lost world of  French Algeria in the 1950's. The historical part of the novel is  incredibly accurate. Let me tell you that I have learned a lot of important  parts of history in this book. I also love the fact that the story is told  through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Lagesse, seen through the eyes of  innocence indeed!  The Last Life is -- without a  stretch of doubt -- the best historical fiction novel I have ever read.  This novel should not be overlooked. Run along and get it!","4":"I was taken in by reviews that compared this book with The Leopard or promised a bildungsroman set in a family that is isolated and on the move.  Well...I didn't feel any parallel with The Leopard and the author overstuffs her story with so many events that isolation is lost in the opportunity for  so many subplots.  And who's moving - in any sense - in this novel?  Where's the \"bildung?\"  The denouement?  The dsillusionner?  I must have  skimmed the wrong paragraph.\nI do agree that parts of the novel are very  engaging.  They are.  And, like some other readers, I did enjoy the events  in Algeria.  This is the strongest part of the novel, perhaps because it is  not so deeply stuck in the protagonist's life that had the unfortunate  knack of boring me in the first-person!  (Yeah, that's what I mean.)  Overall, the novel is just a bit overdone.  I prefer a bildungsroman - if  that's what this should be - to show me a growth, not tell me all about the  all-too-interesting things that happened along the way.\nIf you're the  kind of person who can sit for hours and listen to a friend tell you  endless stories about herself that you can't help but suspect are just a  tad trumped up, then you might really dig into this novel.  Otherwise you  might have an experience more like mine which was one of detached interest.  For my part, I was relieved that I could close the book whenever I wanted  to quiet my jabbery friend.","5":"I read this probably 50 years ago in my youth and I just re-read it for the first time.  It was a fun read but not as good as my memory of it.\n\nBarry","6":"I read every Perry mason book voraciously. Finding the Lam\/Cool mysteries, and getting to enjoy more of Gardner's characters, is like Christmas morning as a kid. Each book is a gift!","7":"I love this series of Bertha and Lamb..  Great novels.","8":"Great read!","9":"Crows Can't Count, A.A. Fair\n\nMr. Harry Sharples came to the Cool & Lam Agency; he was a co-trustee for a trust fund that will terminate when the youngest beneficiary turns 25. One of the heirs, Robert Hockley, is wild and gambles. The other, Shirley Bruce, isn't but refuses to take more than the other. A large part of the estate is in Colombian emerald mines. A jeweler has an emerald pendant for sale. Sharples believes this was part of the estate given to Shirley Bruce. Sharples wants Lam to find out how the jeweler got the pendant, and if any pressure was used (Chapter 1). Chapter 2 describes the preliminary investigation. Lam sees Robert Cameron, the other co-trustee show up. Sharples is surprised and astonished to hear this news (Chapter 3). When Lam and Sharples go to visit Cameron, they find a dead body. They call the police from outside the house (Chapter 4). Sharples tells Sgt. Sam Buda that Cameron had no enemies (Chapter 5). The emerald pendant was there. The police investigate the jeweler and the stockbroker who was visited by Robert Cameron earlier that day (Chapter 8).\n\nLam visits Dona Grafton, who minded Cameron's crow when Cameron left the country (Chapter 11). An anonymous donor sent Dona a box of chocolates. Lam inspects the crow's nest. Lam learns that Robert Hockley was getting a passport and decides to follow him (Chapter 12). The police bring Lam to Sharples' residence. His office is disordered as from a struggle, and Sharples is missing (Chapter 15). Lam meets George Prenter on the airplane, and hears of the wonderful life and climate in Medellin Colombia (Chapter 16). A visitor surprises Lam and we learn the true facts behind the earlier events (Chapter 17). Lam learns that someone else has been killed (Chapter 19).\n\nLam and Cool get a telephone call about a prison escape. They will be guarded (Chapter 21). Lam and \"the delightful Senora Cool\" will be allowed to return to California as soon as possible (Chapter 22). Then Lam visits Dona Grafton and asks questions (Chapter 23). There is amazing testimony from a witness in Chapter 24. Lam places a call to the police so they will get an interpreter and notary public. This written statement will convict a businessman of fraud, and affect the wealth in a trust. Lam explains the facts behind the scandal (Chapter 25). [Do you remember the story of King Solomon and the disputed child?] The pieces of the jigsaw puzzle fall into place, just as the apple falls close to its tree (Chapter 26). One benefit of this story is the description of the trip to Colombia.","10":"Fresh from Connecticut, Taylor Henning lands a dream job at a major movie studio. Okay, so she's not a Creative Executive whose job it is to read and recommend screenplays for the studios to produce. No... she's just an assistant to the assistant of the powerful Iris Whitaker, President of Production.\n\nWhen first assistant Kylie Arthur sabotages Taylor at the first opportunity she almost gets fired. That's when Taylor realizes that Hollywood is just like high school. If you're not in, no one wants to be your friend.\n\nIn order for Taylor to survive in this environment she enlists the help of Iris' sixteen year old daughter Quinn. Irritated to no end Quinn nevertheless takes on the challenge and begins texting Taylor \"rules\" to get ahead in the cut throat world of the movie business and amazingly enough her tips are working! That is until Quinn's next rule is to steal Kylie's boyfriend. Torn between doing the right thing and securing her real dream job Taylor has some tough decisions to make.\n\nI LOVE, LOVE, LOVED this book!! It was so much fun. Yes it did remind me a lot of The Devil Wears Prada but Taylor became a cherished character and I very much wanted her to succeed. I even loved the snarky Quinn. She was a spoiled brat but she had a good heart and I was rooting for her too. This is a fun breezy read that I recommend to all chick lit lovers.","11":"I don't know about you but I would hate to have to go through high school again. All the cliques and having to worry about trying to see if you could become popular makes me shudder to even think about it. That's why I could never even think of applying for a job like Taylor. It's sad to say that I probably wouldn't last very long. What I really liked about Taylor is that even though she works in Hollywood, and has the untimely job of being a second assistant, she's not ditzy. She's really quite smart and knows about the actual movie industry even though she's not too knowledgeable about the hierarchy about moving up.  I really liked learning about scripts and background knowledge myself.  It makes the movie industry become more real when you know this stuff and not just like some magical wonderland.  Taylor is also realistic and relatable. This book does not having annoying slang thrown around by characters and there's not really that much name or label dropping.\n\nIt's funny seeing her battle wits with Kylie with each trying to outdo and slam down the other. Although Quinn appears to be of help to Taylor, it's also a testament to the lack of parenting that goes on in the industry.  I'm really not a fan of how teens can do all these things, ruin people's lives and then get completely away with it. The only qualm is that this is a storyline that has been done numerous times. Almost every chick flick that takes place in a magazine setting has done this plot. Therefore you know exactly what's going to happen. However the story is so engaging and the plot is witty and funny that it really doesn't matter and you get sucked up into the the lives of the characters.\n\nIf you are looking for a great book to bring to the beach this is it. It's a fun read that totally helps you to escape from the normal routines of daily life and brings you to the glamorous world of the rich, famous, and beautiful. I wish this book was part of a series because I would love to learn more about Taylor's life and the world of Hollywood cliques. HIGHLY recommended.","12":"Obviously the premise of this book first struck me as a knockoff of The Devil Wears Prada. I was pleasantly surprised, however, to discover that this was not another tale of assistants putting up with impossibly awful bosses; rather, Taylor's boss was not the problem - she's the kind of classy lady you would want to work for - instead it was Taylor's fellow assistant who turned out to be the complete psycho.\n\nTaylor's character wasn't wildly appealing, but the story was funny, fast-paced and truly captured the lives of many assistants. I was interested, I wanted Taylor to prevail over her seemingly-insane roommate and her shallow judgemental co-workers - even when the story took some unrealistic turns, I was rooting for Taylor to win. I definitely recommend this book as a quick and fun summer read.","13":"I am very happy that I have never been a fan of the \"Hollywood\" scene or that I never found myself \"needing\" to go Hollywood - because if I base myself on the novels I have been reading about Hollywood, this is NOT a place that I want to be.\n\nIn Hollywood is Like High School with Money, we discover that Taylor Henning has, unfortunately, been bitten by the mighty Hollywood bug as she finds herself in the lowest of all the positions (or is that security guard at the gate?).  She is an assistant and she is desperately trying to move on up in that world.  Enter some competition\/potential BFF??? - especially Quinn who is loaded with advice, but is she giving it to help Taylor or destroy her?\n\nThis novel, which I thought was a fun and devilish read is loaded with true moments of what I would call some true Hollywood horror experiences and stories - as Taylor struggles to stand above it all, she finds herself caught in two worlds - that of her conscious and that of the real Hollywood scene.  What does a sweet, innocent (but quickly becoming less innocent by the minute) girl do to get ahead?  stick by her beliefs or become one of the backstabbers.\n\nI loved that the author explores this issue in an honest and fortright manner - especially through the character of Quinn - which I pretty much hated for much of the book, but also thought was pretty true to the storyline.\n\nThis book made me want to scream at Taylor to run far away, but at the same time, I wanted to keep reading to get more \"dish\" on the whole scene.\n\nOne of those great beach read\/end of summer books that you love to read.","14":"\"Hollywood is Like High School with Money\" by Zoey Dean is a charming story about trying to break into the film business and staying there without getting stabbed in the back. Again, another story about Hollywood I had to read; but this time from the viewpoint of an assistant (the lowest of the lowest in that world). This one is funny and quirky and an easy read. Certainly, a good book to escape to the beach with!","15":"Synopsis:\n\nTaylor Henning started her dream job at a major Hollywood studio. For as long as she can remember, Taylor has loved movies. The reclusive director Michael Deming and his seminal work Journal Girl have been a particular inspiration for Taylor. Although she's never received a response, Taylor sends Deming updates on her Hollywood experience.\n\nTaylor soon finds that life as a second assistant involves small tasks and not the selection and producing of \"great films,\" at least to start. But more than the type of work, it's her co-workers that make Taylor miserable. It's like high school all over with the popular girls and their mean tricks. Taylor's too much of a nice girl to acclimatize. Outwitted one too many times by first assistant Kylie and with her job at risk, Taylor asks Quinn, her boss's popular teenage daughter, for tactical advice. It's not about being mean. It's about being confident. Not taking anyone's @#$%...Fake it till you make it...Speak up in class. When you're quiet, you're invisible...Make 1 cool friend...Lunch is a battleground...Enlist a faithful assistant. Taking Quinn's advice, Taylor wins victories against Kylie.\n\nAs Taylor starts to come into her own, a creative executive position opens up. Competing against Kylie and the other assistants for the promotion, Taylor proves willing to use darker methods to advance.\n\nReview:\n\nHollywood is Like High School With Money is the first Zoey Dean novel that I've read. Though the plot seems straightforward and predictable, Zoey Dean sets up the conflicts wonderfully. It may be that I'm inured to violence and too sensitive to female bullying, but when I got to where Kylie was setting the first trap for Taylor, I found the tension unbearable. I had to pause, put the book down, and come back to it. After that break from the book, I couldn't put it down. When Taylor seemed naive and too trusting, Dean gave her enough wit to make her likable. As Taylor grew accustomed to manipulation and was veering to the dark side, I still cared about her.\n\nOverall, Hollywood is Like High School With Money is a light, satisfying read. I highly recommend it as a fun escape.\n\nPublisher: Grand Central Publishing (July 23, 2009), 288 pages.\n\nCourtesy of Hatchette Books Group.","16":"This remote, for whatever reason, was chosen by Time Warner to replace their previous silver remote, the Time Warner Synergy V RC-U62CP-1.12S.  The actual function of this CLIKR-5 is OK, but the ergonomic design sets back remotes by 20 years.  The buttons are all the same, there's no separation of the number buttons, the volume and channel buttons are the same shape as the other buttons on the remote, and it all adds up to a crappy user experience.  Why would TWC accept this as a replacement?  This remote is virtually impossible to pick up and use without staring at it to make sure where your fingers are.  Heck, you have to feel around just to figure out if you've grabbed it by the top or bottom, since there's no articulation in the body of the thing to tell you which end is up.  Horrible, just horrible design.  I'm skipping this and paying double for a refurbished Synergy V.","17":"Worked out of the box with my cable box in northern California. Better than the original. It was easy to program for the tv too.","18":"I have an older URC-WR7 remote and thought this would be an upgrade (and because TWC stuck me with it), but this one fails where the other one didn't.  The old remote could go head to head and learn.  I have 2 different Blu Ray players (LG & Panasonic) and this one fails on both.  It cannot learn buttons.  The biggest problem is in streaming when I need to hit the blue, red, yellow, green buttons.  These cannot work either of them, so I have to pull out the remote for that one setting.  I don't know why they give you multiple code methods but no learning.","19":"Works great!","20":"Cool","21":"Came with a \"bright house networks\" logo, but worked on Time Warner box perfectly.","22":"very nice....","23":"Works great","24":"First time I've EVER had a remote that needed no programming whatsoever so I have to give it bragging rights.  All the other 8780Ls I've had certainly had to be set up first.\n\nYes I wish it was Silver or White or some color that would permit its buttons to be more easily read but its thinner in hand than the ATLAS OCAP 5-Device Cable Remote Control 1056B03 so its the best thing I can find for a Samsung DVR with Samsung TV on the TWC system in NY.","25":"volume buttons do not work.","26":"Got them and only 2 of them worked. company called me after the feedback and told me they would send me a refund. The 2 that are working are doing fine. I like the lighted feature a lot for the night time.","27":"Works like it should","28":"I got tired of the remote being on the wrong side of the bed.

It arrived quickly and was double packed inside a heavily padded envelope. Will buy again if my dog gets ahold of this one!","44":"Had to replace my old TWC remote as some of the buttons wouldn't work. This is a bit upgraded and works just as good","45":"My old Time Warner remote was causing me to pull my hair out. Bought this and has worked like a charm. All along I thought my TWC box was to blame and all I had was a defective remote. Should TWC have provided me a replacement? Yes. But this was much faster and works great.","46":"It works. It's interesting, I got one assembled in Mexico and it recently started to not work without a hard push on the buttons.\n\nThis one, identical in every way, is assembled in Korea. Seems to be better made.\n\nGo figure.\n\nBut, it works,,,, I am happy","47":"IT WORKS WONDERFUL.........","48":"Works just fine, quick delivery.","49":"Saved a bundle buying this from Amazon and not the cable company.  Works great!","50":"It works but the button layout is terrible.  Half the time the wrong button gets pressed - annoying.","51":"I purchased this product not to use in commerical trucking but rather to use when I am traveling with my 5th wheel RV.  So far this product as been very good.  Rand McNally folks seem to be working to continue to improve the software along with prompt updates.  Although designed for the trucking industry it works great for us RV folks as well.  I found for a 2500 HD pickup the unit is a little large for the windshield.  I use the unit with a mount that fits in my cup holder and that has worked out great.  I would recommend this product.","52":"Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.\n\nNow on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.\n\nAnother thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.\n\n Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI's\n\nTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.\n\npros:\nLarge screen\nterrific images\noutstanding volume\n\ncons:\ninability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and vias\na somewhat outdated POI information.\nNon-truck specific routings.\nCost.","53":"This is a great truck GPS. I've tried others and nothing seems to come close to the Rand McNally TND-700.\n\nExcellent screen size and resolution. The audio is loud enough to be heard over road noise and the purr of my Kenworth\/Cat engine. I've used it for the last 8,000 miles or so and it has only glitched once. Just restarted it and it picked up on my route right where it should have. The exit lane screen has been spot on every time and gives me plenty of time to get my rig into the appropriate lane safely. I also love the multi-stop route planning and use it a lot. Updated regularly, it has shown me all the construction zones and has a feature to allow me to detour around them. Creating Groups and storing locations in them is a breeze so I can separate warehouse from store locations, etc.\n\nI'm running an HP Pavilion laptop with Windows 7 OS for the dock and update. The USB port DOES charge the GPS, at least with my laptop, despite the warning in a previous review. Even if it didn't, the supplied 12-volt and AC chargers take care of getting the battery up to speed.\n\nMy complaints are relatively minor:\n\nBattery life when it is unplugged isn't great. However, since I use it plugged in in the cab 95% of the time, it doesn't create too much of a problem.\n\nThe announcement of state borders coming up is nice but it doesn't tell you (or show you on the map display) what state you are in and\/or going into. Again, a minor issue because I know where I am but all my other GPS units had this feature. For $500 smackers, I don't expect this kind of slip-up.\n\nThere is a Micro SD slot on the unit and I bought a card for it. Unfortunately, the manual has absolutely no information on using it. The only reference is on the page showing the physical features of the unit, showing the position of the slot. Annoying.\n\nClean up the minor issues and this unit rates a solid 5.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rand-McNally-528881469-7-inch-Intelliroute-TND-700-Truck-GPS\/dp\/0528881469\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rand McNally 528881469 7-inch Intelliroute TND 700 Truck GPS<\/a>","54":"My brother is a trucker and pre-ordered this.  He was out on the road when it arrived, so he asked me to charge it, update it, and play with it.  FUN!  I am not a trucker, but from what I hear from my brother, the tools on this device are awesome.  It looks like it would be very helpful for him.  The thing is huge, a 7\" screen!  Overall, this seems to be a great tool.\n\nMy problem with it is that it cannot update.  I have a brand new computer running Windows 7 64 bit.  It's a Dell Studio XPS 8100 (i5 processor).  After reading on forums and contacting Rand McNally, I have learned that Windows 7 does not send enough power to the USB ports to allow the TND 700 to go into \"connected\" mode when it's plugged in to a computer.  Supposedly this is a problem that occurs mostly with laptops and some Dell systems (\"Dell Latitude or Inspiron PC (it may occur on other models as well)\").  Rand McNally send a very helpful email with some solutions to the problem, though it sounds like they are still unsure of all fixes or what causes the problem.  I am disappointed that a brand new device does not work with a brand new operating system, though that seems to be the nature of all things now-a-days.  I am hoping that it will update on my brother's XP laptop. we'll see when he gets back home.","55":"Works great when I tape up  the plug to the port. I see why this was for sale.  Other than that it works fine.","56":"Did not work. I'm sure the seller knew this before he shipped it. Out dated and cannot be used at all. Those are words from the manufacturer.","57":"No up dates after 3 years!","58":"It was great.","59":"We got this GPS for my husband who is an (OTR) over the road trucker.  Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \"trucker\" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!","60":"I've had mine for a year and here's what we got. It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.\n\nMy suggestion is to by a nice Garmen. My one rated for cars actually routes me better than this one rated for trucks.\n\nWayne","61":"I did a lot of comparison shopping and decided to buy the Rand McNally 7\" GPS.  Has better graphics than Cobra 7\".  It does have lane assist which is important when in large metro areas and need to be in correct lane for exits, etc Atlanta, GA.  I have read some of the negative comments written earlier and I do not have those problems.  Sure, sometimes it does not give the fastest or the simplest route but it has never sent me down a non truck route like all the prior gps i have had in the past.  I am a car carrier so I set truck size at 13' 8\" and it has kept me from going down roads with 13'6\" bridges.  The only negative comment I have is that it constantly changes map views from city to county to state way to often.  Other than this, I love the fact that:  1) it shows mileage to destination, arrival time (which you can change to time left),  2) shows the city, county and state you are current located (how often we truck drivers pull over at a rest area or truck stop and wonder what city we are located).  3) large 7\" color screen for easy viewing and screen changes automatically for night time driving  4) list truck poi and non truck poi (wish Rand McNally had a feature that would let us send them an update for poi, maybe when we get at a Loves that use to be a Pilot, just tap on the screen and edit info, then when I connect gps to computer for weekly update the map will get updated.  5) able to update construction info by linking gps to computer and get updates given to Rand McNally by the states.  Unfortunately like usual  the states are mostly behind on updates given to Rand McNally.  This is where we the consumer should have the ability to tap screen and make corrections and send it to Rand McNally.  Many times I have gone into areas that it said \"Construction Ahead\" and no construction is being done because it has been completed.  6)  speed limits of highways and Interstates and shows your current speed just below it (also shows truck speed limits in red) Still the states have to report these limits to Rand McNally and as usual they are slow on reporting.  But still most of the time 95% it is correct.  7)  great truckers tools like driving hours left.  It automatically changes to driving when truck has moved for more than 1 mile and changes to off duty if it is idle for 15 minutes.  It lets you know when you have 1 hour left to drive and that driving time has expired. You reset every day manually.  Also have total hours worked for day and hours left to work for the week. You will have to manually override this sometimes because it doesn't distinguish off duty and on duty hours well, you have to manually tell it you are on duty.  I just manually configure at the end of the day.  The important one is driving hours and end of the week hours.  8)  service reminders for your perimeters you set, such as 8000 and 16000 services.  You reset manually when completed.  9)  able to set many multiple stops set and ability to add more stops in route  10) loud enough to hear spoken text to speech street names over engine noise (and believe me my truck is loud)  11) ability to save your own poi (I do it all the time)  12) it tells you when you are 3 miles from approaching a weight station (you can configure it up to 5 miles)  13) it tells you when you are 1 mile from state border and tells you when you cross border and what state you are in.  14) it tells you all mileage you driven that day and mileage by state and mileage by day.  saves info for 1 year.  Overall, this is definitely a truckers friend and I absolutely love this GPS.  A definite must buy.","62":"Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.","63":"Daughter thought it was a good read.","64":"Roland Smith's account, one of life for a teenage English\/American boy in Burma, is marketed as a story for youth.

I found a resource online that is helping them analyze the characters\/setting\/themes\/etc. and learn about foreshadowing and flashback. They are enjoying the story because it isn't just another WWII story about the Nazis.  Instead, it is WWII when Japan invated Burma.","70":"Roland Smith's account, one of life for a teenage English\/American boy in Burma, is marketed as a story for youth.

Well, she couldn't put it down. I spoke to the teacher and she said all the kids are really enjoying it. It's a great book for a tween boy or girl.","72":"I think we read this with our son in 3rd grade and again in 5th.  For a boy it is wonderful, with WWII history, an exotic locale, adventure, danger, rampaging elephants and more.  A wonderful and very accessible coming of age story.  We've read 3 or 4 of Smiths books -- a great \"go to\" author for kids in the upper elementary age group.","73":"I highly recommend Elephant Run, by Roland Smith. Elephant Run is set during World War II in Burma, which is located in Southern Asia. The main character is 14-year-old Nick Freestone who lived in London, England. After Nick's parents' apartment was destroyed during the German bombing of London, Nick's mother and father both decided it would be safest to send Nick to Burma to stay with his dad on a plantation to get away from the bombing.\n\nAfter a few days in Burma, the Japanese forces attacked their plantation, taking Nick's father as a prisoner of war, leaving Nick to stay with the rest of the Burmese who were given the choir of building an aircraft hanger for the Japanese. Nick finds a way to escape with the help of a Burmese monk of high importance. The monk's niece joined them on their escape. Once they had left the plantation without being spotted, they hitched a ride on a couple of elephants and rode them over to the prison site where Nick's dad was being held.\n\nThanks to the help of a Japanese friend, Nick's dad was able to escape, too. While all four of them were escaping, two guards who were patrolling the prison gates spotted them. The elephant that had assisted Nick on his journey to the prison camp saw that the guards were wearing tiger pelts around their necks. The elephants, thinking that they were a threat because of the tiger pelts draped around their necks, charged the guards and killed them. Nick, his dad, and the monk's niece all were able to find refuge from the war in Australia.\n\nI thought that Elephant Run was a great book.  It was very suspenseful and it held my attention all the way through. I think that anyone would enjoy this book, especially people who are interested in learning about World War II.","74":"I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  It was pretty exciting and a fun read.","75":"I am seriously wondering if I read the same books as everyone else.  I began reading with high hopes for two great thrillers based on other reviews, but I was sorely disappointed.  First of all, the sentence structure was choppy, with many sounding as of they were written by my eight year old.  Secondly, in an ill-conceived effort at humor, the protagonist comes off like a self-righteous jerk--and a sexist one at that.  Third, there were so many spelling and grammatical errors in the kindle edition (\"accept\" instead of \"except\"--twice, by the way...) that I wanted to take a red pen and edit the book myself!  Both books made for an interesting afternoon read, but the second book's big \"shocker\" I had pegged as soon as the character was introduced!  Overall, I was not impressed, but I will read the third book just to see where the story goes.","76":"Nice mix of mystery and humor.  Good book to read on vacation.  Characters (and they really are) are interestingly developed.","77":"Never met a book by J. R. Rain I did not Love!\nThe uber cocky, uber endearing Knighthorse\nIs someone u want to know and befriend. The whole side story with him and \"God\"  is a surprisingly funny,  thought provoking ongoing conversation,  that I hope continues.  Great read!!","78":"I loved this book but then again I love all the books I have read so far by J. R. Rain.","79":"I love these Jim Knighthorse. It was a good deal for 2 great books. I worthwhile read for all readers.","80":"A good read! I would read it again if I had time. A lot of adventure and excitement. Great read for on the train.","81":"Writers who crank out as many books as Mr. Rain have always amazed me.  I am also amazed that mostly women read his books.  Nothing wrong with reading about blood suckers and ex-football players right guys?  Okay, I digress, back to the Knighthorse book review.  I enjoy sarcasm.  I employ it often and well.  Reading a book involving mayhem, murder and sarcasm is quite enjoyable.  I have purchased the 3-pack of Knighthorse and found a recurring theme in each book.  If the next book also has the sameness, I will be disappointed. I did enjoy the three pack.","82":"These two books have two very well told stories without killing you with useless details or scenes that don't really contribute.  Both books were fun to read although I enjoyed Dark Horse the most.  The author has a knack for the \"one line zingers\" in each story and the charachters have cockiness about them that is almost comical, but at the same time, that adds to the fun of reading the stories.  Well Done!!","83":"I received my purchase in perfect condition, The packaging was in great shape, and the product is brand new. You can tell that it is new because it is a bit stiff when you open it, as is any new book. Very happy with this product and would definitely buy again at this price.","84":"It's great","85":"We're rough on cables, often breaking them at the connection after a few months. This one eliminates that as a possibility, and a year later, we still haven't broken it!","86":"Good condition","87":"After purchasing cheap cords from another website, I was a little scared to purchase. So glad I did though!  It works great and the design will keep the cord from breaking so easily. Price is still kind of high for a power cord but it is worth it.","88":"Bought for someone else.","89":"Excellent cover. Very fancy and looks great on my Nook","90":"Very quality build. Exterior point of view look great but slightly to thick","91":"This is a great charging cable for the Nook.  It is way better than the one that came with the original Nook Color.  The only downside is you cannot use it on the computer to add books to your Nook.  This was not an issue for me because I have other cables for that.","92":"Should of been given to Nook customers who had to replace their cord. This one works great.","93":"Finally we can charge the nook again!","94":"Great deal. The same case that was 40.00 at the BN store. Get this.","95":"very nice item","96":"Since B&N no longer carry the Nook Color, or the cases... this one is actually better and cheaper than what I had originally bought from B&N.","97":"works great with nook color","98":"The 90 degree connector is a bonus that allows her to read while it is charging without the older style straight connector sticking down.  This cable does everything including charging, and data transfer, works just as well as the original that came with her Nook Color, but better.","99":"Great solution to original power cord.  New design gives the cord a better position so that it won't twist and wear out.  Seems to be well made and has stood up to daily use without an issue."},"summary":{"0":"A star is born","1":"A stream of consciousness novel","2":"I'm a huge fan of the author and this one did not disappoint","3":"The most beautiful book I have ever read!","4":"A dissenting view--In part.","5":"Above average mystery","6":"Lam is cool!","7":"Five Stars","8":"Five Stars","9":"A Fast and Far Moving Adventure","10":"A quick fun read","11":"A Great Beach Read","12":"Quick & fun summer read with some twists","13":"Perfect beach\/end of summer read","14":"Funny and Quirky","15":"Fun, satisfying, summer read - would be hilarous movie!","16":"Ergonomic nightmare","17":"Paid full price","18":"Cannot Learn","19":"Five Stars","20":"Awesome","21":"Works","22":"Five Stars","23":"Five Stars","24":"zero programming needed!
